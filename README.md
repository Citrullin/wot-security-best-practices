# WoT Security Best Practices
This is the repository for the 
W3C Web of Things (WoT) Security Best Practices document.
This is currently a work in progress and should not be cited as an
authoritative source.

* [WoT Security Best Practices](https://w3c.github.io/wot-security-best-practices/):
A set of suggestions on 
how WoT systems can be implemented to support security and privacy.

If you are viewing this on github, you may have to download and save to
a local directory before opening it in a web browser for it to render
properly.

If you wish to make a contribution,
please be aware that since the master is being linked from other WoT documents
we want to keep it as stable as possible and are staging commits through
the "working" branch.
Issues and pull requests should be made to that branch, not master.
Conversely, if you want to see the latest (unstable) version,
checkout the "working" branch.
Issues should be filed against the working branch and will be closed when
updates are released to the master branch.
